# Loan-Prediction-Program

This program predicts whether or not someone can be approved for a loan by using the KNN Classification Algorithm. Used pandas to quantify all the data to be fed into the algorithm. used Standard Scaler to normalize all the data points since the KNN algorithm uses the distance between other points to classify. Found the ideal K value by testing out every K value from 1 to 40 and using the Root Mean Square Error to find out which K value had the lowest error rate. 

**Results**
Precision weighted average of 83%
Recall weighted average of 84%
F1-Score weighted average of 77%
